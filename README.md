# LED_ON_OFF_USING_POTENTIOMETER_HARDWARE_TIMERS
Voltage Monitoring with Timer Interrupts: This Arduino project uses a Timer1 interrupt to periodically read a potentiometer value and display the corresponding voltage on an I2C LCD. It also controls an LED based on whether the voltage is above or below a 2.5V threshold. Includes example code for using Timer1 for periodic tasks.
